  "Yggdrasil workspace facade — STORAGE-4 scaffold.

   Wraps `yggdrasil.workspace` to coordinate snapshot/branch/merge across
   heterogeneous storage backends (Datahike, Datalevin, Proximum) with a
   shared Hybrid Logical Clock. See decision 20260507133442-017631c2 and
   the org.replikativ/yggdrasil library docs.

   Late-bound via `requiring-resolve` so this ns loads even before the
   yggdrasil dep is on the classpath at runtime. Concrete adapters:
   datahike, datalevin, proximum.

   Public API (placeholder — all ops degrade to nil + WARN if yggdrasil
   missing, never throw, never block boot):

   - `start-workspace!`    — open the persistent registry; idempotent
   - `stop-workspace!`     — close registry + cached system handles
   - `manage-system!`      — register a system (e.g. Datahike conn, Datalevin store)
   - `unmanage-system!`    — drop a system from the workspace
   - `coordinated-commit!` — snapshot ALL managed systems with shared HLC
   - `as-of-time`          — query the consistent state of all systems at a wall-clock instant
   - `workspace`           — return the current workspace handle (or nil if not started)

   Lifecycle: in-process registry; the host owns the lifetime. Open at
   boot, close at shutdown."
