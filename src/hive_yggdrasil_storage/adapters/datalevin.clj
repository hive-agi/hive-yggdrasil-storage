  "Yggdrasil adapter for Datalevin LMDB stores — STORAGE-4.3.

   Datalevin lacks a native Datalog-level time-travel API (no `as-of`,
   no `since`), but its KV layer exposes LMDB-level snapshot rotation
   plus a WAL watermark surface:

     dl/create-snapshot!    rotate `current` / `previous` LMDB snapshots
                            + update WAL snapshot-floor bookkeeping
     dl/list-snapshots      enumerate snapshots with metadata
     dl/txlog-watermarks    return WAL LSN watermarks
     dl/open-tx-log         read WAL records from LSN range

   This adapter maps Yggdrasil's Snapshotable onto those KV-level
   primitives. Snapshots are addressed by the WAL LSN that floors them
   (durable, monotonically increasing) — `snapshot-id` returns the
   stringified LSN. `snapshot-meta` joins the LSN with `list-snapshots`
   metadata.

   Branchable is implemented as a labelled-snapshot registry held in an
   in-process atom: `branch!` records `{branch-kw → snapshot-id}`,
   `checkout` switches the current-branch ref. Datalevin does NOT
   support divergent writes on non-:main branches without a CoW LMDB
   layer — branches here are read-tip labels, not independent history
   forks. Mutations always land on `:main`; non-:main branches only
   enable point-in-time read views once `as-of` is wired up.

   ## Mapping table

     Yggdrasil method              ←→  Datalevin
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     SystemIdentity/system-id      → adapter-supplied
     SystemIdentity/system-type    → :datalevin
     SystemIdentity/capabilities   → static (snapshotable + branchable)
     Snapshotable/snapshot-id      → str of WAL LSN watermark
     Snapshotable/parent-ids       → set of prior LSNs from list-snapshots
     Snapshotable/as-of            → ::unsupported (no Datalog as-of in
                                     Datalevin 0.10.x — KV snapshot
                                     re-open path is the follow-up)
     Snapshotable/snapshot-meta    → list-snapshots entry by LSN
     Branchable/branches           → keys of branches-atom
     Branchable/current-branch     → @current-branch-atom
     Branchable/branch!            → swap! branches-atom assoc
     Branchable/delete-branch!     → swap! branches-atom dissoc
     Branchable/checkout           → reset! current-branch-atom

   ## Gaps (not implemented — see ::unsupported below)

   - `Snapshotable/as-of` — Datalevin lacks a Datalog `as-of` op. The
     KV `create-snapshot!` rotates physical LMDB snapshots that could
     be re-opened at a separate path, but exposing that as a value-
     semantic read-view requires a path-aware open-conn dance owned
     by the workspace, not the adapter. Tracked for follow-up.
   - `Mergeable` (merge!/conflicts/diff) — needs a Datalog-level
     three-way diff engine. Out of scope for 4.3.
   - `Overlayable` (overlay/advance!/...) — Datalevin has no live-fork
     observer mode at the LMDB layer.
   - `Graphable/Committable/GarbageCollectable/Addressable` —
     deferrable; the workspace coordinator can opt-in per call site.

   Calling an unsupported method throws `ex-info` with
   `{:err :datalevin/unsupported-protocol-method ...}` so workspace
   coordination surfaces the gap instead of silently no-op'ing.

   ## Caveats

   - `branches-atom` is **not durable** across JVM restarts; the
     workspace coordinator owns durable branch persistence (konserve-
     backed registry). Tests that exercise restart semantics need a
     workspace-level fixture, not this adapter alone.
   - `snapshot-id` is a stringified LSN — opaque to callers, but
     comparable lexicographically when zero-padded. Adapter does NOT
     pad; consumers who sort must coerce to long.
   - `create-snapshot!` is a writer-side op; calling it concurrently
     with active transactions is documented Datalevin behaviour
     (rotation is atomic at the WAL boundary)."
